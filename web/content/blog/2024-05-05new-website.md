I haven't update my website since 2021, during which I lost the domain "weileizeng.com" as well. I was looking for a Chinese service provider to host my site, but gitee pages have been down for a while, and Aliyun doesn't provide a good domain. Luckily the GitHub pages still works. My old webpage would take a long time to load in China, and the building tool Jekyll is very difficult to install in China, which I have failed for many times. Hence I decide to make a new lightweight static webpage, using connvient tools.

My final choices goes to Pelican, a python package, and that is all! See more in [https://github.com/WeileiZeng/weileizeng.github.io](https://github.com/WeileiZeng/weileizeng.github.io) if interested in detail.

My previous choice of jekyll was very smooth while developing it in US. The Internet was fast, plusing the support of GitHub pages and Netlify. I learned a lot by diving into the detail, and modify as much as I can. However, when I looked it back from now, at a different country, it become very difficult to maintain. I am not even able to recover the online page and the developing tools. Hence, this time, with Python and Pelican, I will make the procedure as neat as possible, keep minimal amount of dependancy, and get the developing suit availbe everywhere in a second.

I will be updating research, technical notes, news and life here.
